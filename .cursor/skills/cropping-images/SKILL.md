# Cropping Images

## Use This Skill When

Apply this skill when the user already has local images in one folder and wants:

- visible-frame-only crops
- cropped JPG copies saved next to the source images
- optional deletion of the original source images

## Command

```bash
python3 src/crop_images.py --folder examples
```

Add `--keep-originals` when the original screenshots should stay in the folder.

## Validation

- Confirm the folder exists.
- Confirm the folder has one or more source images to crop.
- Ensure the top title/header UI is gone.
- Ensure the bottom controls and red seek bar are gone.
